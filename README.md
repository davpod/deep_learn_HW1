# deep_learn_HW1
code for the first home work for the deep learn course
using the https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/overview dataset as the main dataset
using in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/classify-leaves/data as the dataset to add new data for task 2.e
csv-clasifications:
train.csv, the main dataset with all the unbalanced data
train_balanced.csv, the full csv with the more balanced class ditribution
train_split.csv, the balanced training set
test_split.csv, the test set used, is balanced
new_train.csv, the dataset for the classify-leaves dataset from whom we will extract a new class, image renamed to image_id, and all image names went from images/name to name
new_class_train.csv, the new training set containing the new class
new_class_test.csv,the new testing set containing the new class
new_class_fewshot.csv, the dataset containing all images that will turn into the new class.
